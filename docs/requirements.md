# Requirements

Requirements catalog for AIUP PetClinic, derived from [`vision.md`](vision.md).

The **Use Cases** column traces each requirement to the use cases that realize
it. It is the mirror of the `**Requirements:**` line in every
[`use_cases/UC-NNN-*.md`](use_cases/), which is where a link is made: list the
id there, then add the use case here. A `—` marks a requirement no use case
realizes because it constrains how the system is built or tested rather than
what a user does with it; [`architecture/`](architecture/README.md) answers for
those. `RequirementTraceabilityTest` (`./mvnw test`) fails when the two sides
disagree, when an id does not exist, or when a functional requirement is
realized by no use case.

Statuses reflect the current state of the implementation: a requirement is
**Verified** when every use case that realizes it is *Done* or *Tested*, and so
covered by a `UC*Test`.

## Functional Requirements

| ID     | Title                        | User Story                                                                                                                                              | Use Cases                              | Priority | Status      |

| FR-008 | Jump to Single Match         | As a clinic user, I want to be taken straight to an owner's record when the search matches only one owner so that I skip a pointless one-row list.       | UC-004                                 | Medium   | Open        |

| FR-010 | Report Unsuccessful Search   | As a clinic user, I want to be told when no owner matches my search so that I can correct the spelling instead of assuming the owner is unknown.         | UC-004                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-011 | View Owner Record            | As a clinic user, I want one screen showing an owner's contact details, their pets, and each pet's visit history so that I can answer a caller at once.   | UC-005                                 | High     | Open        |

| FR-014 | Add Pet                      | As a clinic user, I want to record a pet's name, date of birth, and species under its owner so that visits can be logged against the right animal.       | UC-007                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-015 | Distinguishable Pet Names    | As a clinic user, I want a pet name rejected when the same owner already has a pet with that name so that I never log a visit against the wrong animal.  | UC-007, UC-008                         | High     | Open        |
| FR-016 | Plausible Date of Birth      | As a clinic user, I want a date of birth in the future rejected so that an animal's age is never nonsensical.                                            | UC-007, UC-008                         | Medium   | Open        |
| FR-017 | Update Pet                   | As a clinic user, I want to correct a pet's name, date of birth, or species so that mistakes made at registration can be repaired.                       | UC-008                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-018 | Book Visit                   | As a clinic user, I want to record a visit for a pet with a date and the reason for it so that the animal's history is complete.                         | UC-009                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-019 | Visit Date Defaults to Today | As a clinic user, I want the visit date pre-filled with today's date so that recording a walk-in takes one field less.                                   | UC-009                                 | Medium   | Open        |
| FR-020 | Stated Reason per Visit      | As a clinic user, I want a visit rejected without a description so that the history explains why the animal came in.                                     | UC-009                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-021 | Visit History in Context     | As a clinic user, I want a pet's previous visits shown while I book a new one so that I can see whether this is a follow-up.                             | UC-009                                 | Medium   | Open        |
| FR-022 | Confirm Successful Changes   | As a clinic user, I want an explicit confirmation after every saved change so that I know the record was stored and not silently lost.                   | UC-003, UC-006, UC-007, UC-008, UC-009 | High     | Open        |
| FR-023 | Field-Level Correction       | As a clinic user, I want rejected input reported on the offending field with my other entries preserved so that I fix one field instead of retyping all. | UC-003, UC-006, UC-007, UC-008, UC-009 | High     | Open        |
| FR-024 | Plain-Language Error Page    | As a visitor, I want an unexpected failure to produce a readable message with a way back to the home page so that I am never stranded.                   | UC-010                                 | High     | Open        |
| FR-025 | Error Page Demonstration     | As a visitor, I want a route that deliberately fails so that the error handling can be shown without breaking anything.                                  | UC-010                                 | Low      | Open        |

## Non-Functional Requirements

|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| NFR-001 | Lists Load Incrementally       | Owner and veterinarian lists must fetch rows lazily as the user scrolls, with no user-visible page controls and no fixed page size.                   | Performance     | UC-002, UC-004                         | High     | Open     |
| NFR-002 | Constant Query Cost per Scroll | The number of rows fetched per scroll step must not grow with the total number of records, so list performance is independent of database size.        | Scalability     | UC-002, UC-004                         | High     | Open     |
| NFR-003 | Deterministic Ordering         | Every list has a defined sort order: an owner's pets alphabetically by name, a pet's visits by ascending date, a vet's specialties alphabetically.     | Usability       | UC-002, UC-005                         | High     | Open     |
| NFR-004 | No Technical Detail Exposed    | Error pages show the failure message only; stack traces and other technical detail appear in server logs and never in the browser.                    | Security        | UC-010                                 | High     | Open     |
| NFR-005 | Navigation Survives Failure    | The error view renders inside the application shell, so the navigation drawer and header stay functional after any failure.                           | Usability       | UC-010                                 | High     | Open     |
| NFR-006 | Use Case Test Coverage         | Every use case in `use_cases.puml` has at least one automated test, and each test method carries the `@UseCase` annotation naming the use case it covers. | Maintainability | —                                      | High     | Verified |
| NFR-007 | Tests Run Against Real Database | Automated tests execute against a real PostgreSQL instance — the local server — no in-memory database and no mocked persistence layer.         | Maintainability | —                                      | High     | Verified |
| NFR-008 | Specification Traceability     | Each of the 10 use case specifications maps to exactly one `UC<NNN><Name>Test` class, so any use case can be verified by running one test class.       | Maintainability | —                                      | Medium   | Verified |
| NFR-009 | Schema Matches Entity Model    | The Flyway migrations reproduce every entity, attribute, type, length, and constraint in `entity_model.md` with zero deviations.                       | Maintainability | —                                      | High     | Verified |

## Constraints

| ID    | Title                     | Constraint                                                                                                                                        | Category    | Use Cases                              | Priority | Status      |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| C-001 | Runtime Platform          | The application must run on Java 25.                                                                                                               | Technical   | —                                      | High     | Verified    |
| C-002 | Application Framework | The backend must use Quarkus 3.40. | Technical | — | High | Verified |
| C-003 | Single-Page UI | The user interface must be an Angular 22 single-page application in `frontend/`, served by the backend and talking to it over a REST API under `/api`. | Technical | — | High | Verified |
| C-004 | Persistence Technology | Database access must use JPA — Hibernate ORM with Panache — mapping the schema Flyway creates; Hibernate never creates or alters it. | Technical | — | High | Verified |
| C-005 | Database Platform | PostgreSQL is the only supported database; tests run against a local PostgreSQL server. | Technical | — | High | Verified |
| C-006 | Schema Ownership          | The database schema must be created and versioned exclusively by Flyway migrations under `src/main/resources/db/migration`.                        | Technical   | —                                      | High     | Verified    |
| C-007 | Local Database for Build | Building and testing requires the local PostgreSQL server (`vb-postgres`); Quarkus Dev Services are disabled, as there is no Docker. | Operational | — | Medium | Verified |
| C-008 | Specifications Rule       | `docs/` is the source of truth. Where code and a use case specification disagree, the specification wins and the code is the defect.               | Business    | —                                      | High     | Verified    |
| C-009 | Parity With Spring PetClinic | The domain model, terminology, screens, and business rules must follow the original Spring PetClinic sample; deviations require an explicit reason. | Business    | —                                      | High     | Verified    |
| C-010 | No Authentication         | The application ships without authentication or enforced authorization; it is assumed to run on a trusted clinic network.                          | Operational | UC-001, UC-002, UC-010                 | High     | In Progress |
| C-011 | Reference Data Maintained Externally | Veterinarians, specialties, and pet types are loaded directly into the database; the application provides no screens to maintain them.        | Business    | UC-002, UC-007                         | Medium   | Open        |

## Notes

- **C-010 versus the actor split.** The use case diagram distinguishes a
  *Visitor* (welcome page, vet directory, error page) from a *Clinic User* (all
  owner, pet, and visit management). With no authentication, that separation is
  a matter of which screens exist, not of enforced access control: anyone
  reaching the application can perform Clinic User actions. This is deliberate
  for the demo but would be the first thing to revisit for real deployment.
- **FR-007 is case-sensitive.** UC-004 BR-001 specifies a case-sensitive
  "starts with" match, so searching `smith` does not find *Smith*. Confirm
  whether that is intended before treating it as a requirement rather than a
  faithful reproduction of the original sample's behaviour.
- **NFR gaps.** The vision states no thresholds for page response time,
  availability, concurrent users, or accessibility conformance, and none can be
  recovered from the specifications or the code. If those matter, they need to
  be supplied rather than invented here.
